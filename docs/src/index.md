# Mstar2t Package

*Transport properties from multi-valley density of states in the relaxation time approximation.*

## Software Features

- Compute electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, carrier concentration, thermal conductivity and Lorentz tensor for multi-valley anisotropic density of states;
- Data visualization: transport properties as functions of temperature and chemical potential;
- Command-line interface and Graphical User Interface;
- Multi-threaded calculations of transport coefficients;
- Comparison between experimental and simulated data;
- Database creation of transport properties of multi-valley density of states.

Some examples of computations using Mstar2t can be found on the [Examples](@ref) page.

See the [Index](@ref main-index) for the complete list of documented functions and types.
